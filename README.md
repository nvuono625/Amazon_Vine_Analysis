# Summary

In summary, there is slight positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program, as the paid reviews have a higher precentage of 5-star reviews. One additional analysis that could support this bias would be to unfilter the dataset, as the results are based off a filter dataset that includes reviews with at least 20 votes. The unfilter dataset contains 4,362,074 reviews and the filter of 20 votes per reviews reduced the number down to 27,884 reviews.
